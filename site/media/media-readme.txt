The media/ directory should contain all of the meda files--such as audio, images, video--for a site
or project. Each media type has its own subdirectory to help keep things organized:

* The audio/ subdirectory should contain all of the audio files, probably in MP3 format, for a
project.

* The img/ subdirectory should contain all of the image files for a project (.jpg, .png, .gif) that
are referenced by an HTML <img /> tag. Images referred to in CSS should be stored in the css/gfx/
sub-directory.

* The video/ subdirectory should contain all of the video files for a project. See
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Supported_media_formats for up-to-date information
on the best formats for presenting native video in HTML5.

If your site presents additional types of media, such as PDFs, those should be kept in their own
subdirectory off of media/ (e.g., media/pdf/)
