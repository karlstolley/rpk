<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--
  File opens with the <!DOCTYPE> declaration above; avoid comments before that line.
  See Chapter 11.
-->
<!--
  HTML opens with the `<html>` tag, including a `lang` attribute that should use the 2-digit
  ISO code that describes the language the majority of the page is written in. `en` is for
  English; other codes can be found at . See Chapter 11.

  The `class` of `nojs` is a placeholder class, used for styling pages where JavaScript is
  not active. The RPK JavaScript file, `js/site.js`, swaps out `nojs` (no JavaSCript) with
  `hasjs` (has JavaScript). See Chapter

  Finally, the `id` attribute should be changed for the domain where a page is hosted.
  `example-com` would be for `example.com`. The id on the book’s companion site is `webpg-es`,
  for `webpg.es`. That `id` is known as a CSS signature, and can be referenced by users who
  use custom stylesheets to modify how their browsers render a particular site. The technique
  was described in Andy Clarke’s book *Transcending CSS*.
-->
<html lang="en" class="nojs" id="example-com">

<!--
  Next, the `<head>` tag opens, and uses the RDFa `prefix` attribute to set a namespace, `og`,
  for the Facebook Open Graph Protocol (OGP) metadata. If you do not use OGP, you can remove the
  `prefix` attribute-value pair.

  If you decide to use OGP elsewhere in your document, the `prefix` attribute should be moved to
  the `<html>` tag.

  See Chapter 25 for more on OGP as well as the OGP documentation at http://ogp.me/
-->
<head prefix="og: http://ogp.me/ns#">

  <!--
    Every complete page should open with a <title> tag. This uses a simple, accessible colon
    to divide the page title from the site name. See Chapter 16 for the discussion on separators
    and whether to place the page title or site name first for your site.
  -->
  <title>Page Title: Site Name</title>

  <!--
    The `meta` tag with the `charset` attribute sets the encoding of the page to UTF-8, or
    Universal Transformation Format, 8-bit. See Chapter 10 for a discussion of UTF-8 and the
    need to encode your HTML files in your editor as UTF-8.
  -->
  <meta charset="utf-8" />

  <!--
    The viewport meta element below instructs capable mobile browsers to display your page in
    a mobile-friendly way. See the complete discussion of the viewport meta element in Chapter
    14.
  -->
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,shrink-to-fit=no" />

  <!--
    Two `<link>` tags here load up the screen and print CSS files.

    Note that both `<link>` tags are using root-relative paths to the files. If you have control
    over your site's root directory or are using a proper local development server, like the
    `http-server` that can be installed with Node.js, root-relative paths will work anywhere in
    your site.

    If you need to use relative links, remove the opening slash from `/css/`. For example:

      <link rel="stylesheet" media="screen" href="css/screen.css" />

    If you need a relative link that references your CSS file from a subdirectory off of your site
    root, you'll need to add `../`. For example, an HTML file in the `/site/about/` directory
    would reference a CSS file in `/site/css/`` like this:

      <link rel="stylesheet" media="screen" href="../css/screen.css" />

    For more about paths, see Chapter 21. CSS is discussed in Chapter 12, and in detail in
    Chapters 17, 18, and 19.
  -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" media="screen" href="/css/screen.css" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" media="print" href="/css/print.css" />

  <!--
    Next comes the basic stack of OGP meta tags. They are commented out in `prototype.html`, and
    should either be deleted if you opt not to use them, or uncommented by deleting `<!--` above
    and `-->` below this stack of `<meta>` tags with `property` attributes.

    See Chapter 25 for more on OGP as well as the OGP documentation at http://ogp.me/ for guidance
    on correctly writing the `content` attributes on each OGP property.
  -->
  <!-- Open Graph Protocol Meta Tags: -->
  <!--
  <meta property="og:type" content="website" />
  <meta property="og:title" content="" />
  <meta property="og:site_name" content="" />
  <meta property="og:description" content="" />
  <meta property="og:url" content="" />
  <meta property="og:image" content="" />
  <meta property="og:image:type" content="" />
  -->

<!--
  The `<head>` tag closes here.
-->
</head>

<!--
  The `<body>` tag then opens, which will contain all of the content for your page. `<body>`
  is discussed at length in Chapters 11 and 16.

  If you have a page that requires that are styled differently in a significant way from the
  majority of your pages, you can add a `class` attribute on body. For example, the home page
  `<body>` tag can be enhanced like this:

    <body class="home">

  Your CSS can then open any home-page-only styles with the `.home` selector as part of a
  descendant selector. See Chapter 16 and 18 for guidance on this technique, and Chapter 12
  for more information on different types of CSS selectors.
-->
<body>

<!--
  The only `<div>` tag in the RPK. The purpose of this `<div>` tag, which has absolutely no
  semantic value, is to provide some styleable strucure to the entire page. If you do not use
  it, you can and should remove it, and its closing tag at the bottom of the page, just before
  the `<script>` tag.
-->
<div id="page">

  <!--
    Here is the first of the new HTML sectioning elements, `<header>`. Its use is described in
    Chapter 16. When a `<header>` is used for content that describes the entire page, it can
    be useful to assign it a matching `id` value.
  -->
  <header id="header">
    <!--
      The first line of content is a semantically rich `<h1>` tag, probably the only one that
      should appear on the page, which includes the name of the site and a full, canonical URL
      to the site’s home page. The `<a>` tag here also uses the `rel-home` microformat, which
      is detailed at http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-home
    -->
    <h1><a href="http://example.com/" rel="home">Site Name</a></h1>

    <!--
      Next comes a site tagline, which can be a slogan or a short descriptive phrase that
      summarizes your site.
    -->
    <p class="tagline">Site Tagline</p>

    <!--
      Rounding out the `<header>` for the page is the `<nav>` tag, which surrounds an unordered
      list of links to the major areas of the site. Chapters 7 and 8 discuss the accessibility
      and usability of site navigation. Chapter 16 discusses the structure of navigation areas
      in HTML, and Chapter 21 covers how navigation fits with your site architecture.
    -->
    <nav id="navigation">
      <ul class="navigation">
        <!--
          This first item takes an `accessibility` class and is hidden from view in the RPK's
          `css/screen.css` file. See Chapter 7 for a discussion of accessibility enhancements
          to navigation for low-vision users and users of other assistive technologies.
        -->
        <li class="accessibility"><a href="#content">Skip to page content</a></li>
        <!--
          These two links, to Home and About, use root-relative links. If you need to use
          relative links, remove the opening slash before `/about/`. The link to `Home`
          will depend on how you have created the architecture of your site. See Chapter 21.
        -->
        <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="/about/">About</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>

  <!--
    Here, the `<main>` tag opens. `<main`> can only be used once per page, and should not
    have nested within it any repeating content, such as a repeated `<header>` or `<footer>`,
    or a site-wide `<aside>`. `<main>` is discussed in Chapter 16, and the MDN documentation
    for it is at https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main

    As another landmark section, `<main>` has its `id` attribute set to `content`, which is
    referenced in the accessible navigation using a fragment identifier (`#content`). See
    Chapter 16.
  -->
  <main id="content">

    <!--
      The RPK default structure uses an `<article>` element, which will likely be the proper
      sectioning element for most conetnt pages. An alternate pattern, using `<section>` as
      the primary grouping element, is presented below.

      Whether `<article>` or `<section>` is the primary element, it can take a landmark `id`
      value of `primary`.
    -->
    <article id="primary">
      <!--
        `<article>` and `<section>` elements must open with a heading element of some kind
        in order to be considered valid HTML. See the content-sectioning elements documentation
        on MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element#Content_sectioning

        Because the site title is structure in an `<h1>` tag above, the primary section can open
        with an `<h2>` tag. Any nested `<section>` elements will open with `<h3>`. If those
        sections are divided further, `<h4>` would be the next level of heading. See Chapters 11
        and 16.
      -->
      <h2>Page Title</h2>

      <!--
        This little paragraph is just for informational purposes. Note that it is being properly
        used as a paragraph. Only use the `<p>` tag to mark up content that is actually a
        paragraph: something that is at least a sentence or standalone phrase that is not
        a heading, as in the site tagline in the `<header>` above.
      -->
      <p>
        Begin your design work the mobile-first way by sizing your browser window to be very
        small, to the point that the sentences in this paragraph wrap to fill least 6 or 7 lines.
        For better control over the browser viewport, work on your site in <a

      <!-- Pattern for long <article> with multiple <section> elements: -->
      <!--
      <section>
        <h3>Section Title</h3>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Section Title</h3>

      <section>
        <h3>Section Title</h3>
      </section>

    <!--/#primary-->
    </article>

    <!--
      Use this markup pattern instead of <article> for a <section>-based overview-like page:

    <!--
    <section id="primary">
      <h2>Page Title</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>Article Title</h3>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Article Title</h3>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Article Title</h3>
      </article>
    </section>
    -->

    <!--
      An `<aside>` tag appears here for structure supporting or sidebar-style content that
      is relevant to the entire page. As the comment below notes, `<aside>` should be nested
      with respect to the content it supports.
    -->
    <aside id="supporting">
      <h2>Supporting Content Title</h2>
      <!--
        If the supporting content is related to a specific article or section, nest your <aside>
        inside the relevant <article> or <section> tag. Do not reuse the `supporting` id if
        you have multiple <aside> elements on a page.

        And if the supporting content is repeated over multiple pages, move your <aside> element
        outside of the <main> tag.
      -->

    <!--/#supporting-->
    </aside>

        The `colophon` list item, if you choose to include it, can contain links to projects like
        the RPK itself, as well as to any libraries or other services used to create and deliver
        your site. Including the colophon is, like any content in the RPK, optional.

        There are also two links to the HTML and CSS validators; they use a special ‘referer’
        syntax and will only function properly on a publically available web server. They will
        not work on a development server like `http-server`. So you will need to manually
        validate your HTML and CSS at https://validator.w3.org/ and
        https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ until your site is live.

        Fun fact: *colophon* is a term derived from traditional book publishing. Some books
        include a short statement about the typefaces used in the book, artwork appearing on
        the cover, etc. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing)

  Finally, at the very close of the page, this `<script>` tag loads up the RPK’s JavaScript
  file, which by default loads the jQuery library in a clever way and makes some minor
  modifications to the `<html>` tag’s opening `nojs` class.

  If you do not plan to use JavaScript, you can delete the `<script>` tag.
