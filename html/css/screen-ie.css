/*IE 7 Styles*/

/*
  If you are having problems with IE 7 styling your pages,
  you can try writing corrective styles in this file.
  
  While IE 6 can be a problem, too, it's just not worth 
  trying to fix issues for that browser, simply because
  the rest of the Web is moving on and IE 6 users are
  probably getting used to sites looking horrific in
  their browsers.
  
  That said, many fixes that you might need for IE 7
  generally tend to help out IE 6, too.

  For more information about serving specific styles to
  different IE browsers, see
